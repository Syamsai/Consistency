Welcome to the **Consistency** repository! This space is dedicated to helping you embrace the power of consistency in your coding journey. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, maintaining consistency in your codebase is a fundamental practice that can significantly enhance the quality and readability of your work.

## Rules for Daily Coding Consistency
Consistency is built through daily commitment. To foster this commitment, we've laid out some rules that, when followed, will help you spend at least 1 hour coding every day:

1. **Set a Daily Goal:** Start each day by setting a specific coding goal for that day. Whether it's solving a bug, adding a feature, or learning a new concept, having a clear goal helps drive your coding practice.

2. **Allocate Time:** Dedicate a specific time slot for coding each day. Treat it like an important appointment that cannot be missed.

3. **Eliminate Distractions:** During your coding hour, eliminate distractions as much as possible. Put away your phone, close unrelated tabs, and create a focused coding environment.

4. **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Consider using the Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25 minutes of focused coding followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four cycles, take a longer break.

5. **Reflect and Document:** At the end of each coding session, reflect on what you've accomplished and document your progress. This reflection helps you track your consistency and celebrate your achievements.

6. **Accountability Partner:** Find a friend or colleague who shares your commitment to consistent coding. Keep each other accountable and share your daily achievements.

7. **Stay Positive:** Consistency can be challenging, but stay positive and remind yourself of the long-term benefits. Each day you code brings you closer to your coding goals.
